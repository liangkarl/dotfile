# Introduction
This is a light weight dotfile configuration for my shell environment.
For there are many fancy shell extensions I have used on the
internet, some of them are too slow to develop in a large project
or required many resources to do their jobs. So here I'd like to keep
this configuration fast, useful, and easy to use.

# Goals
* Integrated Shell environment.
* Easy to mantain installed scripts

# Include
* tmux (with tpm)
* git / tig
* bash
* nvim (with coc)
* gcc
* python
* ccls
* clang / llvm
* fasd
* some small tools (still increase)

# Requirement
* `bash` ver. more than 4.x 
* Mac/ Linux system
