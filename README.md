# Introduction
A light weight dotfile for Shell environment.

Although there are many fancy shell extensions on the internet,
not all of them are suitable for large project due to performance
issue.

I'd like to keep the environment more simple, easy and efficient,
so I would try to get rid of complicated extensions.

## Integration
### Primary
* tmux
* git/ tig
* bash
* nvim

### Misc
* gcc
* python
* ccls
* clang / llvm

* ...

### Requirements
