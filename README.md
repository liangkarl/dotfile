# Introduction

A light weight dotfile for Linux BASH shell environment.

Though there are many fancy CLI tools on the internet, not all
of them are suitable for large projects due to performance issues.
I've filtered out some tools and keep the rest putting together
working efficiently.

To make the environment more simple, easy and efficient, I would
follow the KISS principle as possible as I can.
