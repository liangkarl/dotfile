# Introduction

A light weight dotfile for shell environment.

Although there are many fancy shell extensions on the internet,
not all of them are suitable for large project due to performance
issue.

To keep the environment more simple, easy and efficient, I have
tried serveral plugins to filter out improper ones.

### Configs
- tmux
