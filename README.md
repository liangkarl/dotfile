# Introduction
    This is a light weight dotfile config for my shell environment.
Due to some performance issue, I can't introduce too complicated
framework or tools. I'd like to keep this config file easy and
simple to use.

# Goals
  * Simple scripts for install / configuration / uninstall
  * Make Vim-like shortcuts as much as possible.

# Include
  * tmux (with tpm)
  * git / tig
  * bash
  * nvim (with coc)
  * gcc
  * python
  * ccls
  * clang / llvm
  * some small tools (still increase)

# OS / Shell
  * Ubuntu 16.04 / bash
  * Ubuntu 18.04 / bash
