# My Ubuntu Shell Config

## Introduce

  Since I hate re-typing every command after install new Ubuntu system. I
have tried to write some simple scripts before, but they are difficult
to maintain or modify since different OS version. I wanna try another way
to break down such goddamn infinite loop.

## Goal

1. Simple scripts to mantain/modify
2. Less manual operation while installing
3. Make integrated key-binding while using many programming tools

## Include

tmux (with tpm)
git / tig
bash
nvim (with coc)
gcc
python
ccls
clang / llvm
some small tools
(still increase)

## OS & Shell

Ubuntu 16.04 / bash
Ubuntu 18.04 / bash
