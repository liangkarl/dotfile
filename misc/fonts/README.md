## SauceCodePro

A great font that makes the text easier to recognize due to no extra curve,
underline. The width between each characters is great that you won't feel
pressed if the screen is filled with many text.

## MesloLG

Similar with `SauceCodePro`, but `g` looks more modern and easier to recognize.
The line is thicker and the character is thinner than `SauceCodePro`'s, so it's
recommended to use `S` if you don't want the character become too crowded

### Symbol
- `L` means `Large`
- `M` means `Medium`
- `S` means `Slim` or `Small`
- `DZ` unknown

## SpaceMono

A wider font compared to the previous two, it has classical `g`, 'i', 'r',
and `l`. For the last three characters, it didn't add too much underline
making these characters look like underlined in a word.
