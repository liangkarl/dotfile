-- Plugin: which-key
-- https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim
--
-- `WhichKey` is a lua plugin for Neovim 0.5 that displays a popup with
-- possible key bindings of the command you started typing. Heavily
-- inspired by the original `emacs-which-key` and `vim-which-key`.

-- Run ':checkhealth which_key' to see if there's any conflicting
-- keymaps that will prevent triggering WhichKey
require("which-key").setup {}
